Sentence Transformers ("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

 Features

 Upload resume in PDF format
 Smart skill detection with normalization (OOP, ML, DP, etc.)
 AI-based job role prediction
Role ranking using similarity scores
 Missing skills identification

- PDF parsing may fail for complex or scanned resumes
- No job description matching
- Static skill database
- Generic roles may rank higher due to common keywords

Future Improvements

- Add job description matching
- Improve parsing using PyMuPDF
- Section-based scoring (Skills > Experience > Projects)
- Build full-stack version (React + Flask)
